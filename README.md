# Hey there, I'm George ðŸ‘‹
And welcome to my profile!

## About me
Technology is everywhere, and the number of ways it can be used is endless. You can use technology to to call and text your friends, or command a group of [dancing robots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7atZfX85nd4 "Boston Dynamics - \"Spot's On It\"")!

### Programming
I am currently teaching myself programming. I've learned how to use a variety of tools and languages. Some of the things I've learned include:
- Building web pages and building UI with tools like React and TailwindCSS
- Creating and managing databases, as well as creating complex queries and scheduled tasks using Postgre SQL
- Automating tasks like network configuration capture using Python and Paramiko

### Technology 
I am also practicing my OS management skills. I like to learn new concepts, then try to replicate some in my own virtual home lab. Some of the skills I've picked up include:
- Virtual machine and virtual network setup and configuration with VirtualBox
- Firewall management using tools like `firewalld` and `iptables`
- User and group creation, as well as permission management
- Linux command line and tools
  - Cron jobs
  - Bash scripting
 
### Security
I believe security ties in closely with the above two sections, programming and technology. You can never be too safe online. I like to learn new concepts on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/), because they provide the opportunity to discuss what potential vulnerabilities are in programs and applications, then let you play with the concept in their online sandbox of vulnerable machines.
